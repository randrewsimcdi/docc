# PCI Compliance FAQs

*“Following PCI security standards is just good business. Such standards help ensure healthy and trustworthy payment card transactions for the hundreds of millions of people worldwide that use their cards every day.” - 2006-2020 PCI Security Standards Council, LLC.*

## What does it mean to be PCI Compliant?

The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council has developed (and continues to develop and update) payment data security standards that businesses must follow to protect credit card holders. It is important to Pharos to follow these standards and maintain the highest level of integrity in all of our business practices in order to product all of our partners, both agencies and vendors.

For more information on PCI compliance, please visit the Official PCI Security Standards Council Official Website at https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/.

## Why is Pharos asking vendors to connect to Payment Gateways?

Recent years have seen an increase in credit card fraud, which puts businesses at risk if they fail to take preventative measures in the short term. By raising security standards now, you can protect yourself from major problems down the road. Pharos hopes to help lead the way in raising the standard of PC security in the Gift & Home industry with the implementation of the credit card tokenization. This approach is the safest, most efficient way to protect your customers and yourself from fraud and theft throughout the ordering and shipment lifecycle.

## How do I connect my Payment Gateway?

In the Pharos portal, you will be able to connect your Payment Gateway by entering your credentials into the Pharos Tokenizer, a PCI standard industry security system that creates a unique token associated with each credit card. By connecting to a Payment Gateway to charge against these unique tokens, vendors are able to receive and process credit card orders without ever compromising any sensitive payment data.

## How do I know if my Payment Gateway is supported?

Pharos already supports most popular payment gateways and is capable of supporting others.

If you are not using a payment gateway, or want a fast temporary solution, Stripe, a company popular with small to mid-size businesses, offers an easy way to collect and process credit cards with a payment gateway.
