# Onboarding Process for Agency Vendors

## Step 1: Please confirm the following with your IMC_di Onboarding Specialist.

* Contact info for the point of contact within your organization for onboarding
* Your current ERP and Payment Gateway Providers

## Step 2: Decide whether you will be accepting credit card payments or not.

A complete list of payment gateway providers that we currently support, can be found [here](/docs/pci-faqs/#pharos-currently-supports-57-payment-gateways)

## Step 3: Will you receive orders manually or automatically?

### Manual Order Receivable

1. Receive email confirmations as orders come in. This option does not support credit card holders.

### Pharos Sample Order Confirmations Email

2. Login to your Pharos CRM portal to review, download, and print orders. Downloaded order files can be imported into an ERP or accounting system (PDF or Excel formats).

## Step 4: Login to Pharos CRM portal to update your username, email address, and password. If you did not receive your temporary username and password please contact your Pharos Rep or email PharosOnboarding@imcdi.com.

* **Update your username and email address:**

1. Login to [app.pharoscrm.com](app.pharoscrm.com) in with your temporary credentials.
2. Click on **Company Name** (user dropdown) in the top righthand corner of dashboard and navigate to "**My Profile**"
3. Select "**Edit Profile**" to update your username and email address - this must be a valid email address so it can be used to reset your password in the future.

# Step 7: Once connected to your payment gateway, ask your Onboarding Specialist to place a test order.

* Within 24 hours you will get a credit card token for you to charge against in your payment gateway. Please charge the card for $1, and then **immediately refund the transaction.**
* If you do not receive a test order within 24 hours or you have issues charging the token in your payment gateway, please reach out to your Pharos Rep or email PharosOnboarding@imcdi.com.
